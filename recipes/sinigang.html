         <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> 
            Sinigang is a sour soup made with tamarind as the souring agent. It is usually made with pork, beef, or fish, and vegetables like kangkong, radish, and tomatoes. 
            Other souring agents like guava, calamansi, or kamias can also be used to make the soup.
            <br>
            <br>
            The sourness of the broth can be adjusted by adding more or less tamarind, and the dish is often served with rice. 
            Sinigang is a staple in many Filipino households and is enjoyed all year round, but it is especially popular during the colder months.
