      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li> 1 kg pork intestines, thoroughly cleaned and cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li> 6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li> 1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup vinegar</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup water</li>
            <li> Cooking oil for deep frying</li>
           
        </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

         <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, boil the pork intestines in water until tender. This may take around 1 to 2 hours. Drain the intestines and set them aside.</li>
            <li> In a separate bowl, mix together the minced garlic, salt, vinegar, and water to make the seasoning. </li>
            <li> Heat up enough oil in a deep fryer or a large wok to deep fry the pork intestines.</li>   
            <li> Once the oil is hot, carefully add the pork intestines to the oil and deep-fry until crispy and golden brown. This may take around 5 to 7 minutes.</li> 
            <li> Once the pork intestines are crispy and golden brown, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove any excess oil.</li>
            <li> While the chicharon bulaklak is still hot, pour the seasoning over the top and mix well to ensure that each piece is coated evenly.</li>
            <li> Serve with cold beer and vinegar sauce. Enjoy!</li>
            

        </ol>
