  <h1> Kusinang Pinoy!</h1>

  <article> 
      Growing up as a Filipino, I have always loved eating "lutong-bahay" or homecooked food. 
      It would be my packed lunch thorughout the course of my elementary years until now that I am
      an adult. 
    
     <br> 
     
     From homecooked food to street food, I have always been proud of Filipino cuisine. Why?
     kasi masarap! ( it is delicious!)
      
       <br> 
       <br>

       There are a lot of Filipino dishes that I would love to share with you, but here are my top 5
       that I will never get tired of eating (seriously, they are that good).
